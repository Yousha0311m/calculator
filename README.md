**How I made it**
Step 0: Make a folder for the project    
Step 1: Add the tsc configaration files using "tsc --init"    
Step 2: Installing the dependencies of project which are inquirer and @types/inquirer     
Step 3: Require the ibrary we installed     
Step 4: Take input of operation user wants to perform which is =,-,* or /     
Step 5: Check if the operator is valid and user did`nt type any invalid operation    
Step 6: According to the operation take input numbers     
Step 7: Check if numbers are valid and not an alphabet
Step 8: Perform calculations and store in variable (before we perform calculation we need to convert the string/character into and integer)    
Step 9: Show/Output the variable to user as the result
